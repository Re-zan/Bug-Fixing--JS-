            Question 01: What is the difference beetween map, foreach, find and
            filter?
          </p>
          <p class="py-3">
            Ans: <span class="text-blue-700 text-lg">Map: </span> Map iterates
            every elements in the array and it's returned us a newarray. But it
            doesn't modified the main array.
            <br />
            <span class="text-orange-800 text-lg">Foreach: </span> Foreach
            iterates every elements in the array and it doesn't return.But it
            also doesn't modified the main array.
            <br />
            <span class="text-rose-600 text-lg">Filter: </span> Filter iterates
            every elements in the array. We have to give a condition on the
            filter method.Filter method gives us a new array. The array contains
            thoese values which are fulfil by the conditon.
            <br />
            <span class="text-amber-600 text-lg">Find: </span> Find iterates
            every elements in the array. We have to give a condition on the Find
            method.Filter method gives us an element which is matched by the
            conditon.

          <p class="py-3">
            Ans: V8 engine is Javascript run time which is a free and
            open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium Project for
            Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. It has two part. <br />
            1. Heap.<br />
            2. Stack.<br />
            Every Functions are stored in the stack in LIFO way. asyn functions
            are settimeout , setinertveral, AudioContext,
            MediaElementAudioSourceNode etc. These api functons don't run on the
            stack. Stack send them to WebAPi section when the functions are
            ready to run then thoses functions come to the Call queue in FIFO
            way. Synchronous functions are only completed in stack part. Once
            all the Synchronous functions are completed then Call queue send
            functions which are stored on that section. But it doesn't happen
            without event loop. Basically event loop work as a bridge. Event
            loop check the stack section when it will empty.When event loop see
            that stack section is empty then event loop send a function from
            call queue to stack section. Stack section will complete the rest of
            aSynchronous functions.

            sets a setInterval. SetInterval contains a count function and
            duration. Count starts from 0. But it increases the number after 1
            second.If count second goes over 60 seconds then red color will be

            Ans: <span class="text-blue-700 text-lg">Local Stroage: </span> The
            capacity of local Stroage has 5MB/ 10MB. Theer is no way to send
            data client side to server side. The data will remain until we don't
            clear the storage. Eevn if we close the tabs or off the computer the

            Session Stroage can't send data to the sever side. Datas will be
